    Morning in the cabin means Jhon shuffles out in wool socks, feeds the bossy blue jays,
    and warms his hands on a chipped mug. The clouds slide low over the trees like sleepy
    whales, and Jhon whispers, “One good day at a time,” before testing the porch steps
    that creak like old friends.

    By noon, Jhon’s got a rhythm: split a few logs, set a kettle, fix the latch that keeps
    arguing with the wind. He talks to the forest like it’s a neighbor—asks the pines for shade,
    thanks the moss for being so soft, and nods at the clouds drifting by on their lazy patrol.

    At night, the path glows with starlight and Jhon scribbles in a weathered journal—
    notes about birdsong, a sketch of the crooked tree, a promise to explore the creek tomorrow.
    The cabin pops and sighs around him, and somewhere out there, the forest listens back.
