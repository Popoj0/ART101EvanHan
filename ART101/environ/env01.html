    Tucked in Evan's cozy forest cabin, Jhon wakes to birds doing karaoke and pine trees gossiping in the breeze. 
    He brews a mug of something warm, pokes the friendly fire, and steps outside like it's his tiny kingdom. 
    No traffic, no buzz, just moss, mugs, and mischief. Forest life suits him just fine.
